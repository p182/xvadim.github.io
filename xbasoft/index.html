        <p>A simple barometer for monitoring atmospheric pressure.
            The goal of μBarometer is to be useful, small and elegant.<br>
            Features:
            <ul>
                <li>Pressure units: mBar, mmHg, inHg, atm</li>
                <li>Altitude units: meters, feet</li>
                <li>Pressure Graph</li>
                <li>Altitude Indicator</li>
                <li>App widget with three themes</li>
                <li>Pressure value in the status bar</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>The pressure graph shows the change in pressure in 48 hours. To collect data 
            μBarometer runs a small service which saves the pressure value every hour.</p>

        <p>The altitude value are based on the current pressure value. 
            For quick switching between pressure/altitude indicators just tap on the indicator icon.
            You can measure the relative altitude.
            Just tap on the altitude indicator and it will show the relative altitude from 
            the current point.</p>

        <p>Filler (aka Flood-It or 7 Colors) is a well-known puzzle game. 
            You play against a human or computer opponent on a field with color squares.
            Your goal is to occupy as many squares as possible. Elements of the selected
            color are occupied if they are adjacent (have common edge) to the already 
            occupied squares. But you cannot select the current color of your opponent.</p>

        <p>
            Filler Classic has two game modes:
            <ul>
                <li>multiplayer, i.e. human vs. human (on the same device or via Bluetooth or
                    the Internet)</li>
                <li>human vs. AI (with four difficulty levels)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Puluc (also Bul, Buul or Boolik) is an ancient Mayan running-fight board game.
Initially the game had ritual significance. Mayan played Puluc the night before the sowing of maize.
The game was designed to give strength to revive grains.
This game is a little bit like such games as Backgammon.</p>

<p>
Rules:
<ol>
    <li>The overall objective is to capture and subsequently kill the playing pieces of 
        the opposition. The playing area is divided up into equal spaces using rods, 
        placed parallel to each other. The two players have control of a base at either 
        end of the play area. The players take 5 chips and place them in their respective bases.</li>
    <li>Taking it in turns, players roll the grains and move any of their chips the corresponding
        number of spaces toward the enemy base.</li>
    <li>When a chip lands on the same space as an enemy chip, the enemy chip is captured and 
        is no longer controlled by the enemy player.</li>
    <li>If a chip lands on an enemy chip which already has prisoners, it captures that chip and
        releases prisoners.</li>
    <li>Once a chip and its prisoners reach home, any enemy chips are removed from the game,
        or killed. Friendly chip is returned to the set of chips which can be played.</li>
    <li>Once a player has killed every enemy chip, they win.</li>
</ol>
