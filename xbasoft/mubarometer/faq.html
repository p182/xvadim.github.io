        <p>Q: <b>Why does μBarometer not collect data?</b></p>
        <p>A: There are several reasons:
            <ul>
                <li>Doze mode - μBarometer can't collect data when a device is in Doze mode</li>
                <li>Some kind of task killers/battery savers can kill μBarometer. Exclude μBarometer from the list of
                killed apps</li>
                <li>Some tools like Zapper Task Killer, Clean Master, Greenify or any Antivirus software can kill
                    μBarometer</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Q: <b>Why is μBarometer show a notification?</b></p>
        <p>A: Beginning with Android 8.0 (Oreo), Google changed the way you’re notified 
            about apps running in the background on your phone. An application which runs background processes should
            sent a notification to users.
            μBarometer runs a such process for tracking air pressure data.
        <p/>
        <p>Q: <b>Can I turn off the notification?</b></p>
        <p>A: You cann't turn off the notification, but can hide it:
            <ol>
                <li>Press and hold on the notification.</li>
                <li>Turn the notification off. </li>
                <li>Tap <b>Done</b>.</li>
            </ol>
            The μBarometer app continues to run the tracking process but won't send the notification. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you hide the μBarometer notification, you’ll receive a different notification from the Android 
            letting you know the μBarometer app is using battery resources. All apps that run in the background 
            affect your phone’s battery life. You can hide this notification as well.
